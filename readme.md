1. [X] get one page to compate to another page
2. [ ] get one sitemap to compare to another sitemap
3. [ ] add this to the CLI process
    To reduce the pages we can test on only english and not the rest of languages. 
        1. Disable the translation plugin, re-generate a sitemap, run the process. re-activate plugin and re-generate the sitemap. [Less effort-small impact for X time while no translation is available??]
            -- what other options do we have? 
                    1.1 [ ] clone prod, turn it off, get the clean sitemap-and only compare those SLUGS after the mainsite.com ?? [NO DOWNTIME ON USERS, Mid effort]
        2. Manually filter through the sitemaps and parse the correct data. [More effort]
            2.1  [ ] is there an easy pattern to spot?
